# BuildingBlocks Java Program

This Java program demonstrates the use of object-oriented principles to manage a collection of building blocks. It creates a set of building blocks, sorts them by different properties, and searches for a specific block based on its characteristics.

## Project Structure

- `Main.java`: The main class that defines the program's logic.
  - `BuildingBlock`: A class representing a building block with properties like name, material, hardness, transparency, and stack limit.
  - The program creates an array of `BuildingBlock` objects, sorts them by hardness and name, and searches for a specific block.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or later.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
